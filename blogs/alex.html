        Once upon a time, there lived a young guy named Alex in a peaceful place. He had a big dream: he sought after fantastic and unique building architectures. Whenever his friends went outdoors to play, he enjoyed sketching the bridges or lofty structures into his notebook.<br><br>

        As time passed, his dream grew stronger. He was diligent; he attended clubs to learn more. His teachers thought he was exceptional, and Alex had big dreams.<br><br>

        But life wasn't always easy. He grew up and came of age, and had almost attained adulthood when something occurred. Math, which was exactly the subject he really needed most for his dream, became a tremendous headache for him. On his major tests, he obtained an unexpected “NO GRADE” in Math. His dreams were crumbling around him.<br><br>

        However, there was a period of difficulties in his life, and he still didn't quit. Could he face math again? Could he rebuild his dreams?<br><br>

        Days became weeks and college replaced high school. His diploma had its imperfections, and he refused to despair. Instead, he enrolled in college for studies of civil engineering, but with doubts in his mind.<br><br>

        Campus life had both thrilling and anxious periods. Could he pass through the tough courses? Where would he get help and support? Could he prove grades were not the only consideration?<br><br>

        The days became exams and difficulties as lessons. Did each of these challenges facilitate Alex’s adaptation and maturity? And did he realize at last, that victory was not only a matter of marks? Did he realize this was even greater than trying his best, being hard-working, and making changes?<br><br>

        The story goes on as Alex stops and looks at his uncertain destiny. Can he be able to achieve the dream of becoming an engineer? Can he have impressive, oversized structures? However, perhaps, the most vital question is other than that. Can his journey inspire others? What will his journey entail beyond constructing houses?<br><br>

        Isn't  life a picture drawn with sweat and courage in which there appear dreams? Alex’s journey shows us that we might still come out with something beautiful even in the worst times so long as we have hope, and we do not abandon our dreams.
